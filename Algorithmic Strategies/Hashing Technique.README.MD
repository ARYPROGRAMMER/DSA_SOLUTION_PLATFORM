<div align="center">Hashing Technique Overview</div>
Hashing is a powerful technique used in computer science to map data to a fixed-size representation, often for fast data retrieval and storage. The hash function generates a unique index for each input, which is then used for various operations like searching, inserting, or deleting data.

For Example:
Count Frequencies of Elements

import java.util.HashMap;

public class FrequencyCount {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5};
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();

        // Count frequencies using a HashMap
        for (int num : arr) {
            frequencyMap.put(num, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }

        // Print the frequencies
        for (int key : frequencyMap.keySet()) {
            System.out.println("Element: " + key + ", Frequency: " + frequencyMap.get(key));
        }
    }
}


Explanation of Count Frequencies:
HashMap: Used to store elements as keys and their frequencies as values.
Insert: Each element is inserted into the map with a frequency count.
Retrieve: Frequencies are retrieved directly from the map, ensuring efficient O(1) access time.

Styling Example: Find Pair with a Given Sum
java
Copy
Edit
import java.util.HashSet;

public class PairWithSum {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {10, 15, 3, 7};
        int targetSum = 17;

        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();

        // Check for the pair
        for (int num : arr) {
            int complement = targetSum - num;
            if (set.contains(complement)) {
                System.out.println("Pair found: (" + num + ", " + complement + ")");
                return;
            }
            set.add(num);
        }

        System.out.println("No pair with the given sum found.");
    }
}

Explanation of Find Pair with a Given Sum:

HashSet: 

Used to store numbers encountered while iterating through the array.
Check Complement: For each number, the complement (targetSum - num) is checked in the set.
Efficient Search: HashSet ensures constant time complexity for insert and search operations.

Use Cases of Hashing:

Counting Frequencies: Use a map to count occurrences of elements in an array.
Finding Duplicates: Use a set to detect duplicate elements.
Searching Pairs or Triplets: Use a set or map to find pairs or triplets with specific properties.
Data Caching: Efficient data retrieval and storage using hash-based data structures.
